## 📥 1. User Input using Scanner

**Task:** Write a program that asks the user to enter their name, age, and city. Print the information in a formatted sentence.

---

## 🔁 2. Loops

**a. For Loop:**  
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.

**b. While Loop:**  
Write a program to print even numbers from 2 to 20 using a `while` loop.

**c. Do-While Loop:**  
Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1 using a `do-while` loop.

---

## ⛔ 3. Control Statements

**a. Break:**  
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but stops when it reaches 5.

**b. Continue:**  
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but skips number 5.

**c. Return:**  
Write a method that calculates the square of a number and returns the result.

---

## 🔠 4. Variable Types

**Task:** Write a program that demonstrates the use of:  
- Instance variable  
- Static variable  
- Local variable

Call a method to show the difference clearly.

## 🧩 5. Methods

**a. No Parameter, No Return:**  
Write a method that prints "Welcome to Java!".

**b. With Parameter, No Return:**  
Write a method that takes your name as a parameter and prints a greeting.

**c. No Parameter, With Return:**  
Write a method that returns the value of π (use 3.14).

**d. With Parameter, With Return:**  
Write a method that takes two numbers and returns their product.

## 📚 6. Arrays

**a. One-Dimensional Array:**  
Write a program that stores 5 marks in an array and prints the total marks.

**b. Two-Dimensional Array:**  
Write a program to input a 2x2 matrix and print its transpose.

## 🔁📚 Loops + Arrays Homework Questions

### 1. Sum of Elements  
Write a program to find the sum of all elements in an integer array.  
Example: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` → Sum = 15

### 2. Find Maximum Element  
Write a program to find the largest number in an array using a loop.  
Example: `arr = [7, 2, 9, 4]` → Max = 9

### 3. Count Even and Odd  
Count how many elements are even and how many are odd in a given array.  
Example: `arr = [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]` → Even = 3, Odd = 2

### 4. Reverse an Array  
Print the array elements in reverse order using a loop.  
Example: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` → Output = 4 3 2 1

### 5. Print All Pairs  
Print all possible pairs from an array using nested loops.  
Example: `arr = [1, 2, 3]` → (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)

### 6. Second Largest Element  
Find the second largest number in an array without sorting it.  
Example: `arr = [5, 3, 8, 6]` → Second Largest = 6

### 7. Check for Palindrome Array  
Check if the array is a palindrome (reads same from start and end).  
Example: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` → Yes

### 8. Frequency Count  
Count the frequency of each element in the array using a loop.  
Example: `arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]` → 1:3, 2:2, 3:1

### 9. Rotate Array Left by 1  
Rotate the array to the left by 1 position using a loop.  
Example: `arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]` → Output = [20, 30, 40, 10]

### 10. Find Duplicate Elements  
Find and print all duplicate elements in an array.  
Example: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1]` → Duplicates: 1, 2
